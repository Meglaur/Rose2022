### An updated game I created as a teenager. Currently still in development.
#

I started working on this project around 2015-2016 as a young teenager. I was just beginning to understand what computer programming is and the first language I tried to learn was C++. This project is filled with a lot of bad coding practices, however, the functionality of the game works. My hope is overtime I can re-work the code while keeping the original concept as I become more proficient as a developer.
