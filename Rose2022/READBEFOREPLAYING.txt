Hi there! Thanks for playing my demo game, before you get started, there are a few things you should know...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. To play the game, access the file labeled bin, then the file named Debug within that, and run Rose01.exe!
That should start the game, if it doesnt, or anything doesnt work, text me at 1-815-383-6695 and i can try to
fix it :)

	-if you would like to, you can create a shortcut of the .exe and put it on your desktop to be able to play it without going
	your files. Just left click and choose create shortcut and drag that wherever you want it.

2. This game is labelled a demo for a reason, it is unfortunately filled with bugs. I spent a lot of time creating it and had an enormous
amount of fun, but this was my first major coding project and its not perfect. So expect strange things to happen, its
just kind of part of the experience.

3. The game is run through a command line, meaning it takes your input at each step to continue the game. If something isnt
happening, try hitting enter to continue the game forward, this applies to exiting menu screens, selecting things, etc. A good 
rule in general with this game is if your stuck, try hitting enter.

4. The attacking and defending minigames within a battle run based on the speed of your computer, so as your computer speeds
up and slows down, sometimes those minigames will suddenly speed up or slow down. I'm sorry about this but at the moment that
is an inevitable bug, so be patient and if you need to use creator mode (see below) to give yourself handicaps for fights, feel
free! The beginning of the game should let you select the general speed of your computer however, to hopefully give a base
speed for the game that will run normally.

5.. I've created a few commands you can access in game to fix things should you have problems or just want to play around.
You can access Creator Mode by pressing G while playing, and bring up the command menu by pressing F while in 
Creator Mode. You can change your health, the amount of coins or elixers you have, the location you are at (this works
based on location codes, a list of which I will provide below), give yourself more defense points, access areas that are usually
closed off until certain criteria is met, and give yourself certain items. Its up to you how you use this.
